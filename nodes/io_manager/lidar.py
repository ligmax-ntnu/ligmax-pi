"""RPLidar C1 driver for the **aft** unit: a thread keeping recent sweeps.

    from .lidar import LidarReader
    rd = LidarReader(); rd.start()
    sweep = rd.latest()

This is `ligmax-edge/lidar.py` ported to the Pi, and it should stay recognisably
the same file - the C1 workarounds below cost days to find once and are not worth
rediscovering in a second dialect. Three things differ, all deliberate:

  * the port comes from **this** repo's `config.lidar_port()`, which resolves the
    udev symlink, then /dev/serial/by-id, then the bare kernel name - the Jetson's
    version raises when the symlink is missing, and here a missing aft lidar must
    degrade to "no aft returns" rather than take the node down;
  * it logs through `logging` rather than `print`, because everything this node
    logs is forwarded to the operator's log panel (`upload.py`);
  * a link that will not come up is reported once and then at most once a minute
    (RECONNECT_LOG_PERIOD). The Jetson's copy prints every retry, which is right
    for a foreground process on a bench and wrong for a panel someone is trying
    to read the boat's state out of.

Why a buffer and not "the newest sweep"
---------------------------------------
On the Jetson the buffer exists so a sweep can be matched by TIME to a camera
frame that reached the fusion code ~250 ms after its photons landed. There are no
cameras on this end, so nothing here needs `sweep_near` - but the history is kept
anyway, and cheaply, because it is what makes `stats()` able to say the sensor is
turning rather than just that the port opened.

Three things about the C1 that the `rplidar` library on PyPI gets wrong, all of
which look like a broken sensor:

  * **SET_PWM is not a C1 command.** `RPLidar.__init__` calls `start_motor()`,
    which sends SET_PWM (0xF0) for the A2's motor driver. The C1 spins its own
    motor and answers 0xF0 with nothing at all - and, worse, swallows the
    *next* command too, so the GET_INFO that follows times out and the library
    reports `Descriptor length mismatch`. `C1Lidar` below overrides the motor
    methods to touch DTR only.
  * **Scan mode survives the process.** The C1 keeps streaming after the port
    closes, so a run that was killed with SIGKILL - or any run that did not
    reach its `finally` - leaves the next one reading measurement bytes where
    it expects a response descriptor. That surfaces as `Wrong body size`, or as
    a scan that yields nothing while the raw port is clearly busy. Hence the
    STOP-and-flush before the first command, and again on the way out.
  * **The first measurement is ~2 s behind the SCAN command.** The C1 answers
    SCAN with its descriptor immediately and then sends nothing at all while
    the motor spins up. The library reads measurements with the port's own
    timeout, which defaults to one second, so the very first read times out and
    raises `Wrong body size` again - on a sensor that is about to work fine.
    READ_TIMEOUT below is the fix and is why it is not 1.

Measured on the Jetson's unit, once settled: **10.0 Hz**, 100 ms/rev, ~400
returns at a 0.9 deg step, of which ~100 come back with distance 0 and are
dropped here rather than downstream. The aft unit is the same part; measure it
after it settles, because the C1 comes up nearer 14 Hz and slows over the first
few seconds.
